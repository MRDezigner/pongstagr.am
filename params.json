{"name":"Pongstagr.am","tagline":"Instagram jQuery Plugin","body":"# Stuff required to run the plugin.\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nFor the most part, Instagramâ€™s API only requires the use of a client_id. A client_id simply associates your server, script, or program with a specific application. However, some requests require authentication - specifically requests made on behalf of a user. Authenticated requests require an access_token. These tokens are unique to a user and should be stored securely. Access tokens may expire at any time in the future. More here.\r\n\r\n1. **jQuery 1.8+**, the plugin should also work with 1.4+ but it's not tested.\r\n2. **Zurb's Reveal Modal Plugin** \r\nto display Image details, comments and likes when a thumbnail is clicked. Pongstagr.am works best if you are using Zurb's Foundation front-end framework. Get it [here](http://foundation.zurb.com/).\r\n3. **User ID** \r\nIf you have zero idea what your user id is, you may head to this link: http://jelled.com/instagram/lookup-user-id.\r\n4. **Access Token** \r\nIf you have zero idea what your access token is, you may head to this link: \r\nhttp://jelled.com/instagram/access-token make sure you follow the instructions on the \"How do I get my client id?\" link.\r\n\r\n## How to use the plugin? Super easy:\r\n\r\n**jQuery must be initialised first and so as the plugin:**\r\n\r\n`<script src='path/to/js/jquery.min.js'></script>`\r\n\r\n`<script src='path/to/js/foundation.reveal.js'></script>`\r\n\r\n`<script src='path/to/js/pongstagr.am.js'></script>`\r\n\r\nand we're all set!\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
